Hi guys my Asif and I am an Android Developer based in Ludhiana. Currently Working on diffrent projects that I listed down below. I am also learning about Data Stucture and Algorithms knowing Data Structe helps a lot while writting code . I will like to colloab with people related to android development there is so much to learn. below is my projects that I listed so you can them out. Other than coding and programming I go the gym & read books, play chess [I am noob though].

## Data Structures and Algorithms 

I am also learning DSA. I love solving problems in a more optimized way. I am constantly solving problems  on Leet-Code you can check it out below. Knowing different algorithms and Data Strcuture helps me to build apps in a more optimized way. from chossing which sorting algo will be work based on given data,  all comes handing while buidling apps.
